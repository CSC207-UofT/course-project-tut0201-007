First, the user runs the class **CommandLineInterface**, which then queries the user for the number of courses they want to take. After that, the **CommandLineInterface** queries the user for Course Codes of courses they want to take, stores them, and calls one of our Use Cases, **Scheduler**, which creates a **Schedule**. Internally, the **Scheduler** uses another Use Case, **CourseCreator**, which instantiates a **Course** object using the information retrieved by **APIWorker**. **APIWorker** queries the U of T Timetable API by course code, and retrieves course info in JSON format.

The **Scheduler** calls **CourseCreator** for every course code input. Each time, it also outputs the created **Course** to the CLI. When **Scheduler** finishes, the **CommandLineInterface** prints the string representation of the generated **Schedule**.

## Example

Let's assume for the sake of example that the user wants to take 2 courses, which are CSC258 and MAT237. They will input that through **CommandLineInterface**, which will parse the number of courses as well as the Course Codes. It will use **Scheduler** to generate a schedule for CSC258 & MAT237. In the process, it will use **CourseCreator** twice, for both MAT237 & CSC258. Each **CourseCreator** will use the **APIWorker** to get info on MAT237 & CSC258, respectively. As each **Course** is created, their string representations will be output. That means the Lecture & Tutorial sections of MAT237 & CSC258 will be output. Finally, when **Scheduler** finishes, the string representation of a **Schedule** of MAT237 & CSC258 will be output. This means printing the lecture and tutorial **Sessions** that are in the schedule.
