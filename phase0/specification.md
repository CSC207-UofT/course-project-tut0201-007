The project domain of our group is a Scheduling App that allows Students to specify Courses they'd like to take, as well as criteria for their final schedule.

A user specifies which courses they want to take, and also specify criteria, like "No classes after 5 PM" through the CLI. The program queries the U of T Academic Calendar for the Tutorial & Lecture Sections of each requested course, and creates all schedules that meet the given criteria. 

The user selects a generated schedule, and the program generates ICS invites that can be used with most Calendar Apps.


Additional Possible Features:
* Use Distance between class sessions to support Criteria like "Walking distance must be less than 10 minutes between sessions".
